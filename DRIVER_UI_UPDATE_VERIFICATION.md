- `rideCompleted` ✅
- `driverOnlineConfirmed` ✅
- `driverOfflineConfirmed` ✅
- `queuePositionUpdated` ✅
- `rideCancelled` ✅
- `otpVerificationSuccess` ✅
- `otpVerificationError` ✅

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "actions.goOnline is not a function"
**Solution**: Used `driverGoOnline()` and `driverGoOffline()` from socket service

### Issue 2: "actions.setIsOnline is not a function"
**Solution**: Used `actions.setOnlineStatus()` which is the correct method name

### Issue 3: "Could not accept ride"
**Solution**: Fixed `driverAcceptRide` to use callback for response handling

### Issue 4: Active ride not setting properly
**Solution**: Used setState callback pattern to avoid closure issues

## UI Components

### Status Card
- Shows online/offline status
- Queue position display
- Today's earnings
- Trips completed count

### Active Ride Card
- Customer information
- Pickup/Drop locations
- Fare display
- OTP input for start/end
- Call button for customer

### Ride Request Cards
- Fare prominently displayed
- Vehicle type badge

- Responsive layout adjusts for screen size
- Bottom sheet pattern for mobile
- Large, easy-to-tap OTP input
- Swipe gestures support

## Theme & Styling
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Accent: Blue (#3B82F6)
- Success: Green (#10B981)
- Background: Gray-50 (#F9FAFB)
- Cards: White with subtle shadows
- Consistent with user dashboard theme

## Performance
- Efficient socket event handling
- Proper cleanup on unmount
- Optimized re-renders
- No memory leaks detected

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add ride history view
2. Implement earnings breakdown
3. Add navigation integration
4. Implement driver preferences
5. Add notification sounds
6. Implement offline queue for poor connectivity

## Deployment Ready

## CRITICAL PRODUCTION FIXES - DATA VANISHING ISSUE

### Issue Summary
In production environment, the driver dashboard was experiencing critical data loss where OTP and fare information would appear briefly then vanish, breaking the entire ride flow.

### Root Causes Identified

#### 1. State Synchronization Destroying Data
**Location:** `client/src/contexts/DriverStateContext.js` (Line 351-411)
- The sync-state logic was replacing complete `activeRide` objects with minimal `{_id}` objects
- This caused immediate loss of OTP and fare data after it was received

#### 2. Preserved Session Overwriting Active Rides  
**Location:** `client/src/contexts/DriverStateContext.js` (Lines 748-777)
- On page refresh, preserved sessions were overwriting newly accepted rides
- No check existed to prevent overwriting rides that had OTP data

#### 3. Race Conditions in State Recovery
**Location:** `client/src/contexts/DriverStateContext.js` (Lines 218-284)
- State recovery from localStorage was overwriting active rides without checking data completeness

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. DriverStateContext.js - Critical State Preservation (Lines 368-398)
```javascript
// Don't overwrite activeRide if current has more complete data
if (state.activeRide.startOTP || state.activeRide.endOTP || state.activeRide.fare) {
  console.log('[DriverState] PRESERVING local activeRide with OTP/fare data during sync');
  activeRideToUse = state.activeRide; // Keep existing complete data
}
```

#### 2. Preserved Session Protection (Lines 757-762)
```javascript
// Skip preserved session if active ride exists
if (state.activeRide && state.activeRide._id) {
  console.log('[DriverState] Active ride exists, skipping preserved session');
  sessionStorage.removeItem('driverSessionPreserved');
  return;
}
```

#### 3. Server sync-state Validation (server/routes/drivers.js Lines 1256-1270)
```javascript
// Only send activeRideId if ride is actually active
if (!activeRideOnServer || ['completed', 'cancelled'].includes(activeRideOnServer.status)) {
  serverActiveRideId = null;
  driver.currentRide = null;
  await driver.save();
}
```

### Production Testing Required
- [ ] Accept manual booking from admin
- [ ] Verify OTP and fare display correctly and persist
- [ ] Start ride with OTP verification
- [ ] Complete ride and collect payment
- [ ] Test network disconnection/reconnection
- [ ] Verify data persists through connection issues

### Success Metrics
- No OTP/fare data loss reported
- Drivers can complete full ride flow
- State persists through page refreshes
- No "data vanishing" complaints
