## Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "actions.goOnline is not a function"
**Solution**: Used `driverGoOnline()` and `driverGoOffline()` from socket service

### Issue 2: "actions.setIsOnline is not a function"
**Solution**: Used `actions.setOnlineStatus()` which is the correct method name

### Issue 3: "Could not accept ride"
**Solution**: Fixed `driverAcceptRide` to use callback for response handling

### Issue 4: Active ride not setting properly
**Solution**: Used setState callback pattern to avoid closure issues
